# human_activity_recognition_using_lstm

## INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM  

* Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. Many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system. This Walkrunclass prediction is review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. 

### In this dataset there are 6 sensors out of which 3 are gyroscopic sensors and 3 are accelerometric sensors



# 0 is Walking
# 1 is Running

T-SNE IS HELPING TO SOME EXTENT IN CLUSTERING BUT STILL NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR DECIDING

# Conclusion

After testing the model is performing well. the actual class and predicted class are almost same.
