# human_activity_recognition_using_lstm
# INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM  * Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. Many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system. This Walkrunclass prediction is review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification.
